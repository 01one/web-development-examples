# Project Structure: Simplifying Development

In larger projects, it's essential to break the work down into manageable parts. For instance, when developing a landing page, having all the code in a single HTML document can be very challenging. 

### Recommended Approach

1. **Segment the Page**: Divide the landing page into different sections.
2. **Load Sections Together**: Work on these sections individually and combine them during development to streamline the process.

This approach not only makes development smoother but also helps maintain organization. Once you're ready for production, you can consolidate everything into a single HTML file.
